Okey, I tried to translate everything to English, I am not a native speaker
so don't spect anything perfect.


I am doing this only to keep track my learning and to have it stored in a more "secure"
way, I am not specting feedback or anything aside from ,idk, my teachers? 


I am using the second edition of the C book so it's ANSI.


The output from the school excercises are in Spanish. Why?

 1. I am not sure how to translate it whithout it sounding weird.
 2. It's the language that I use at school.


Oh and note for myself:
To use librearies with gcc use the -I flag with the path to the libraries, it would look something like this:

gcc TheFlagsYouWant/Need -I ~/libraries/


Yes, I like the word 'stuff'.
